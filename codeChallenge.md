Challenge 1: Dynamic Greeting
Objective: Use variables, data types, and string concatenation/template literals to create a dynamic greeting.

Task: Write a program that stores a user's name and age in variables, then prints a personalized greeting using these details. Use both string concatenation and template literals.
Test Data: Name: "Alex", Age: 29.
Challenge 2: Unit Conversion
Objective: Practice arithmetic operators by converting units.

Task: Write a program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and kilometers to miles. The formulas are: Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32 and Miles = Kilometers * 0.621371.
Test Data: Convert 25Â°C to Fahrenheit and 120 kilometers to miles.
Challenge 3: Age Verification
Objective: Use conditional statements to verify a user's age for eligibility.

Task: Given an age variable, write a program that checks if the person is eligible to vote (18 years and above). Print an appropriate message based on eligibility.
Test Data: Age: 17 and Age: 22.
Challenge 4: Grade Calculator
Objective: Implement mathematical operations, conditionals, and logical operators to calculate and classify academic grades.

Task: Write a program that calculates the final grade of a student based on scores from multiple tests. Then, classify the grade into A, B, C, D, or F using conditional statements. Use the average score for classification (90+ = A, 80-89 = B, 70-79 = C, 60-69 = D, <60 = F).
Test Data: Scores: 85, 74, 91, 78.
Challenge 5: Weekend Activity Suggester
Objective: Demonstrate the use of switch statements and template literals to suggest activities.

Task: Write a program that suggests an activity based on the current day of the week. Use a switch statement to cover each day. For example, "coding" on weekdays, "hiking" on Saturday, and "resting" on Sunday.
Test Data: Current Day: "Wednesday".
